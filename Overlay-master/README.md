# ImGui Overlay & Menu
A minimal overlay project using ImGui, Direct X11, and the WinAPI.

## Notes
Shouldn't be used in any program with a kernel level anti-cheat.
If the ImGui window is closed without the user pressing Insert the window styles won't update. (Can be fixed if you move the style update outside of the if statement)
